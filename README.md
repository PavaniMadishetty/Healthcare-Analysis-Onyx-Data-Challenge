# Healthcare-Analysis-Onyx-Data-Challenge

Problem Statement:
As data analysts, we have access to a comprehensive dataset provided by a national healthcare oversight organization, containing 550,000 unique patient records from 10 major hospitals across the U.S. This dataset offers a detailed view of hospital admissions, medical conditions, prescribed medications, insurance providers, and treatment costs. Our objective is to extract meaningful insights that can enhance healthcare decision-making, optimize financial expenditures, and improve patient outcomes.

Tools Used: Power BI, Power point, Excel, Flaticons

Project Overview: 
This dashboard provides a high-level overview of patient care and hospital performance across 10 major U.S. hospitals, based on 55,500 real patient records.
It is divided into three key areas:

Patient Demographics – Understand admission trends by age, gender, and blood type.

Hospital & Insurance Performance – Compare billing, outcomes, and provider efficiency.

Medical Insights & Treatment – Analyze top conditions, medications, and treatment patterns.

Objectives: 
Our objective is to extract meaningful insights that can enhance healthcare decision-making, optimize financial expenditures, and improve patient outcomes.
